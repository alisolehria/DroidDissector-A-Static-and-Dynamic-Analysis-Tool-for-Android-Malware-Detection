  https://github.com/alisolehria/DroidDissector-A-Static-and-Dynamic-Analysis-Tool-for-Android-Malware-Detection
abstract: >
  DroidDissector is an extraction tool for both static and
  dynamic features. The aim is to provide Android malware
  researchers and analysts with an integrated tool that can
  extract all of the most widely used features in Android
  malware detection from one location. The static analysis
  module extracts features from both the manifest file and
  the source code of the application to obtain a broad array
  of features that include permissions, API call graphs and
  opcodes. The dynamic analysis module runs on the latest
  version of Android and analyses the complete behaviour of
  an application by tracking the system calls used, network
  traffic generated, API calls used and log files produced
  by the application.
